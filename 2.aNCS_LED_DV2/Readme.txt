Preparations for the second development harness.

Aim: To design and build a modular lighting system that can interchangeably upto support 128 outputs for use in a variety of outdoor environments.

Requirements:
	1. All Enclosures, Profiles and Harnessing must adhere to ip67/8 watertight standards.
	2. Half/Full RS485 Duplex Network System that can send and receive to no less than 8 Slaves at a distance of upto 250m.
	3. Be able to send and receive all network information wirelessly, relaying information over large distances and to multiple slaves.
	4. Hardware and software administration panels with full control of all elements in network.
	5. Work [or be easily converted] from multiple methods of input communication (MIDI/DMX/OSC/UDP/BT etc).
